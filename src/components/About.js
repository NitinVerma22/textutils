        <p>
        <b>TextUtils</b> is a ReactJs website built primarily to do various operations on regular typed text. You can safely use WordPad or NotePad for text drafting, and saving, but TextUtils offers much more than simple text drafting and formatting. TextUtils can convert your text to any case in just one simple click of a button. It can extract links and numbers safely from a labyrinth of random text or sophisticated documentation. It has an improved property of base64 encoding, reversal of your inputted text.You can even remove whitespaces from your scripted documents, and wear up your earphones to listen to it, instead of straining your eyes! It does a detailed analyzing of your text, and provides an output of words, and characters, along with reading time as well. The best part of TextUtils is that it is an open source project, as a result, dozens of new features are in the upcoming, which definitely makes it a cut above the rest.
The most eminent features of the website are as follows :

        <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
